the view part is not aware of the bussiness logic, only observing data chnages to set the UI accordingly.
- Rx-Java: This is the java implementation of reactive-x. This library takes asynchronous/Long running tasks off the main thread to the background.
- Retrofit: This is the defacto library for making network calls on android.
- Java: Java is the programming language used to build this project.
- Mockito: Objects. mocked for unit testing was done using the mockito java library.
